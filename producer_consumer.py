#mutex = threading.Semaphore()

#This semaphore is initialized with a default value of 1, meaning it acts as a binary semaphore (or a mutex). It is used to ensure mutual exclusion, allowing only one thread to enter a critical section at a time.

#    mutex.acquire(): If the semaphore's counter is 1 (indicating that no thread currently holds the mutex), the counter is decremented to 0, and the thread can enter the critical section. If another thread #is holding the mutex (counter is 0), the calling thread will block until the mutex is released.
#    mutex.release(): This increments the semaphoreâ€™s counter back to 1, allowing other threads to acquire the mutex and enter the critical section.

#empty = threading.Semaphore(0)

#This semaphore is initialized with a value of 0, meaning no resources are available initially. It is used to keep track of the number of empty slots in a buffer (or similar structure).

#    empty.acquire(): This will block if the counter is 0, meaning there are no empty slots available. When there is at least one empty slot (counter > 0), acquire() will decrement the counter by 1 and allow #the thread to proceed.
#    empty.release(): This increments the counter, representing an additional empty slot, and potentially wakes up a blocked thread waiting for an empty slot.

#full = threading.Semaphore(capacity)

#This semaphore is initialized with a value equal to capacity, representing the maximum number of full slots (or items) that the buffer can hold.

#    full.acquire(): This operation will block if the counter is 0, meaning there are no full slots available. If there are full slots (counter > 0), acquire() decrements the counter by 1, allowing the #thread to proceed.
#    full.release(): This increments the counter, representing an additional full slot, and potentially wakes up a blocked thread waiting for a full slot.
